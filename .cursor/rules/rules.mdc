This is an HTML, CSS, and JS application. It doesn't use any framework. It's a client-side only web application. It needs to be responsive to all major devices.

Make sure the code is writtin in a way that is scalable and maintable.

As you update the code, please make sure that the [README.md](mdc:README.md) and the [rules.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/rules.mdc), and the user onboarding experience stay updated.
